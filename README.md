# Advent of Code 2018 solutions in Rust

I am learning Rust, and doing [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) seemed a good way of doing so.
These are my solutions.

They are not pretty, or clever. They're hacked up to get the answer,
while giving me an opportunity to learn Rust along the way. They're
not idiomatic Rust, as I'm still learning how to use the language.

In short, beware. :)
